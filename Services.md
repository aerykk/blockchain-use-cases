## Use Case #1

Lets say you're listening to Coldplay a lot on Spotify, and they're coming to town. If you allow Ticket Master access to your listening behaviour, they can alert you to that. Same with Amazon and if a CD is released. Your listening history is tokenized and encoded into the blockchain where you control how it's shared.
