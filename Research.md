## Use Case #1

Lets say an institution thinks they can reduce cancer risk by reducing exposure to X and they need data from Y area or Z type of people. You can choose how much and what data you want to allow them to find in their non-identifiable results. What food you've been eating (because it's being tracked automatically), what you've been searching, or what medicine you've been prescribed, it's all tokenized and up to if, how, when and who you want to share it with.
