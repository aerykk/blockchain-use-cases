# Value

## Use Case #1

Real estate, vehicles, etc. will be 'tokenized' meaning a token will exist that puts the related information on the blockchain, who owns a house, where it is, the details, and eventually the ability to transfer ownership yourself without a third party. Sending value/currency directly to a person without a third party will save so many human hours used on paper pushing.
