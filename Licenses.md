# Licenses

## Use Case #1

Lets say I purchased Gears of War 4 for Xbox, using my blockchain identity, I can use PlayStation to install and play, because both Sony and Microsoft are both in the same oracle network for game licenses that you use. Either can choose to tack on an additional cost if they want, but it moves towards a better, efficient (and cheaper) future.
