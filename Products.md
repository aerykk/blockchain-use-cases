## Use Case #1

In the future when you purchase lets say tomato sauce, you'll be able to scan a QR code to look it up on the immutable blockchain. It'll say where it was processed, any manufacturer details (perhaps encrypted), and potentially ingredients and where they came from as well. If it's been recalled/contaminated, your phone will let you know. Ability to easily verify legitimacy (important in some countries like China where people sell fake food - WaBi ICO is working on this). The next step after that is widely adopted, is using that data to determine a more accurate value and demand of something as it's being sold, live.
