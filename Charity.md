# Charity

## Use Case #1

Giving to the poor and having peace of mind you helped somebody will be never be easier than with blockchain. When blockchain identity is commonplace, you'll be able to scan a homeless persons QR code and your app will automatically determine if it should use funds you set aside for charity that month. Based on your specific parameters, such as: how much they've received this month, their age, their ability to work as determiend by medical records (without releasing exact details, the person can allow contributors to see they have a "critical disease").
